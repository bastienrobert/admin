# Todo

## High priority
- Status edit doesn't work on pop-up yet (Other action - period#show)
- Invoice download : how it works through the API
- Custom fields on order show (dashboard#order) to get details about products (color, size, how many in the order...) -> in a table
- What about client and creator mailing ?? NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT

/!\ What happened when status set to Shipped : what about auto delivering, mailing...


## Low priority
- Period form edit is not working
